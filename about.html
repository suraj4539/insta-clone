                        <p>
                            Hi, I'm Jayadeep, I started web development out of curiosity about how websites work. I
                            began with simple HTML and got interested in modern web apps. That curiosity turned into a
                            passion for coding and learning more about web development.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <h4>My Background</h4>
                        <p>
                            Before discovering web development, I was fascinated by technology and its impact. What
                            started as a hobby with websites and basic coding became a serious passion. I spent hours
                            learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I keep expanding my skills with every project.

                    <div class="content">
                        <h4>What Drives Me</h4>
                        <p>
                            Web development is about solving problems and turning ideas into reality. I love creating
                            websites that look great and provide a smooth user experience. The satisfaction of building
                            something from scratch drives me to keep improving.
                        </p>

                        <h4> Skills and Expertise</h4>
                        <p>
                            Over time, I’ve built a strong foundation in front-end technologies with a growing interest
                            in back-end development. Here's a snapshot of my skills:<br>
                            <u><b>HTML & CSS:</b></u> The core of web design, helping me create structured, visually
                            appealing
                            pages.<br>
                            <u><b>Bootstrap:</b></u> Enhances responsive design, allowing me to build flexible,
                            mobile-friendly
                            layouts quickly.

                        <h4>My Approach to Web Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            I believe in a user-centric approach to web development, prioritizing user needs and
                            experiences. Whether it's a simple landing page or a complex web app, I focus on
                            functionality and intuition. I enjoy tackling challenges, finding creative solutions, and
                            continuously learning.

                        <h4>What’s Next for Me</h4>
                        <p>
                            As I grow as a developer, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'm exploring back-end
                            technologies and new frameworks. I'm eager to take on projects that expand my skills and
                            create meaningful web experiences.

                        <h4>Beyond Coding</h4>
                        <p>
                            When I’m not writing code, I enjoy reading comics, playing games, and exploring new things.
                            These activities keep me creative and bring fresh perspectives to my work as a developer.
